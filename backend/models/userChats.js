// This code sets up a user chats model for MongoDB, which stores information about all chats belonging to a user. It keeps track of:

// The user's ID.
// A list of chats for that user, where each chat has an ID, a title, and a creation date.
// The model makes it easy to store and retrieve a list of chats for each user in the database, organizing chat data effectively.
